# FML Sibling Validation Rules
fml_sibling_rules:
  - "If one sibling is mandatory or optional, all siblings must be mandatory or optional"
  - "If one sibling is or, all siblings must be or"
  - "If one sibling is alternative, all siblings must be alternative"
  - "Siblings are features at same indentation level under same parent"

# VML Selection Validation Rules  
vml_constraints:
  mandatory_features: "Must be selected if parent is selected"
  optional_features: "May be selected if parent is selected"
  alternative_groups: "Exactly one feature must be selected in group"
  or_groups: "At least one feature must be selected in group"
  selection_propagation: "Parent selection enables child validation"

# AI Development Guidelines
ai_instructions:
  file_creation:
    - Always start with appropriate use statements (except .ple)
    - Follow with single hdef statement  
    - Use only valid keywords for each file type
    - Follow indentation hierarchy (2 spaces or tab)
    - Use when ref config only in .fun/.blk/.req/.tst files
    - Reference valid symbols from imported files
    
  symbol_naming:
    - Use CamelCase for identifiers
    - Descriptive names reflecting purpose
    - Consistent naming across related files
    - Follow c_FeatureName pattern for configs
    
  validation_awareness:
    - .fml sibling consistency rules
    - .vml selection constraint rules  
    - Cross-file symbol resolution
    - Config-based graying behavior
